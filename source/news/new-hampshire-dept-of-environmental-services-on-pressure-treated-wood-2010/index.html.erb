<p>
The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services released a fact sheet in 2010 that discusses the concerns over pressure-treated wood & its use in residential and marine situations.  The NHDES advises against using pressure treated wood in any waters of the state.  The fact sheet covers a variety of preservatives that have been in use or are being proposed.  In the end, the use of these treated woods is generally a bad idea resulting in a multitude of problems including poisoning of fish and health and cancer risks that outweigh the benefits of the preservative.
